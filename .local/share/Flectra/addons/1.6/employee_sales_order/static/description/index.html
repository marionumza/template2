                <li> To empower the user by providing the decision making knowledge is one of the key areas to focus while implementing ERP.</li>
                <li> Our effort towards providing analysed information mining through the already existed data produces this another new Flectra module.</li>
                <li> The main philosophy to develop this module is connecting sales and human resource management application to enable the right set of data while the user is accessing employee record in Flectra.</li>
                <li> This module is specifically for the Flectra implementation which is using Human resource and sales management application. It helps to bring the power of customer order data to Human resource application.</li>
                <li> In Flectra, sales order and quotation is assigned to the salesperson, not the employee. If you want to see the number of sales order and quotations assigned to the employee on the employee form view and kanban view then this module is for you.</li>
                <li> You can control showing such data to limited number of users as well.</li>
